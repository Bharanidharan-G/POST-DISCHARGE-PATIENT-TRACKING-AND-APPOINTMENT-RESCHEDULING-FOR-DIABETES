# POST DISCHARGE PATIENT TRACKING AND APPOINTMENT RESCHEDULING FOR DIABETES

# INTRODUCTION
  Since millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes, glucose monitoring is essential to managing the chronic illness. For patients who need frequent testing, traditional monitoring approaches entail intrusive procedures that can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Noninvasive glucose monitoring options have surfaced as a result of technological breakthroughs, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor systems. The goal of this project is to create a seamless, affordable, and noninvasive glucose monitoring system by integrating an infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver module with a NodeMCU microcontroller and a cloud-based platform for data viewing and communication.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
  The suggested method uses infrared light to test blood sugar levels without intrusive procedures. Through the use of signal processing and calibration procedures, the IR transmitter and receiver module processes transmitted or reflected signals to determine the glucose concentration. For data logging, visualization, and analysis, a WiFi-enabled NodeMCU sends the processed data to the cloud using the ThingSpeak platform. Better disease management is made possible via cloud integration, which enables consumers and medical experts to monitor glucose trends over time.
  By combining cloud computing, healthcare apps, and reasonably priced hardware, this concept lessens the need for intrusive blood-based monitoring methods. Real-time data access is made possible by the integration of IoT, guaranteeing scalability, dependability, and better healthcare results. This system is a prime example of how IoT advancements may transform healthcare by promoting communication between patients and medical professionals, improving disease management, and raising people's quality of life globally.

## INFRARED TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER MODULE:
  The infrared transmitter and receiver module plays a vital role in this project as it enables noninvasive detection of glucose levels. It works by sending infrared light through the skin and analyzing the amount of light that is reflected back. Since glucose affects how light is absorbed and scattered within body tissues, the variations in the reflected signal can be used to estimate glucose concentration. The transmitter emits infrared light at a specific wavelength that can penetrate the skin and interact with blood vessels. Depending on the glucose level, a portion of this light is absorbed while the rest is reflected. The receiver detects the reflected light and converts it into an electrical signal. These variations in signal strength correlate with the amount of glucose present in the bloodstream, and this data is sent to the NodeMCU microcontroller for further analysis. The effectiveness of this module depends heavily on its hardware configuration. Accurate glucose measurement requires careful alignment of the transmitter and receiver, as well as control over the intensity of the emitted infrared light. Calibration during setup accounts for factors such as skin thickness, sensor placement, and environmental interference. Together, these considerations ensure that the infrared module provides reliable and consistent data for glucose monitoring.

# SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
## Arduino software IDE:
  For the purpose of programming Arduino microcontrollers, the Arduino Software (IDE) is an intuitive platform. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux and provides a complete environment for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino boards. Key features include a serial monitor for real-time communication with connected Arduino devices, a text editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion, and a library manager for simple installation of additional functionality. The IDE simplifies the development process, making it accessible to novices while still offering advanced features for seasoned users.  It comes with built-in support for a variety of Arduino boards and an extensive library of example sketches. From straightforward prototypes to intricate Internet of Things applications, the Arduino IDE is an all-around effective tool for creating a variety of electronics projects.
## ThingSpeak Cloud:
  ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) platform that enables the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of sensor data in real time. It is widely used for IoT-based applications, especially in healthcare and environmental monitoring, due to its simple integration with microcontrollers like NodeMCU and compatibility with MATLAB for advanced analytics. ThingSpeak allows users to
create channels where data from devices can be sent and accessed through the cloud. This real-time data accessibility is beneficial for both users and healthcare providers to monitor trends and take timely actions. Its user-friendly interface and support for automated actions via webhooks make it a practical solution for remote monitoring systems.
## HTML and CSS:
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and forms that form the content of a website. HTML provides the backbone of any webpage, allowing browsers to interpret and display content as intended. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of an HTML document. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a web page, enabling developers to separate content from design. CSS enhances user experience by making web pages more visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
## JavaScript:
 JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language mainly used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs directly in the browser and allows developers to handle user actions, manipulate HTML and CSS, and communicate with servers without reloading the page. JavaScript supports features like functions, objects, and asynchronous programming, making it essential for modern web development. It's also widely used with libraries like jQuery and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to build scalable and efficient web applications.
