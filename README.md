# POST DISCHARGE PATIENT TRACKING AND APPOINTMENT RESCHEDULING FOR DIABETES

# INTRODUCTION
  Since millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes, glucose monitoring is essential to managing the chronic illness. For patients who need frequent testing, traditional monitoring approaches entail intrusive procedures that can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Noninvasive glucose monitoring options have surfaced as a result of technological breakthroughs, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor systems. The goal of this project is to create a seamless, affordable, and noninvasive glucose monitoring system by integrating an infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver module with a NodeMCU microcontroller and a cloud-based platform for data viewing and communication.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
  The suggested method uses infrared light to test blood sugar levels without intrusive procedures. Through the use of signal processing and calibration procedures, the IR transmitter and receiver module processes transmitted or reflected signals to determine the glucose concentration. For data logging, visualization, and analysis, a WiFi-enabled NodeMCU sends the processed data to the cloud using the ThingSpeak platform. Better disease management is made possible via cloud integration, which enables consumers and medical experts to monitor glucose trends over time.
  By combining cloud computing, healthcare apps, and reasonably priced hardware, this concept lessens the need for intrusive blood-based monitoring methods. Real-time data access is made possible by the integration of IoT, guaranteeing scalability, dependability, and better healthcare results. This system is a prime example of how IoT advancements may transform healthcare by promoting communication between patients and medical professionals, improving disease management, and raising people's quality of life globally.

## INFRARED TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER MODULE:
  The infrared transmitter and receiver module plays a vital role in this project as it enables noninvasive detection of glucose levels. It works by sending infrared light through the skin and analyzing the amount of light that is reflected back. Since glucose affects how light is absorbed and scattered within body tissues, the variations in the reflected signal can be used to estimate glucose concentration. The transmitter emits infrared light at a specific wavelength that can penetrate the skin and interact with blood vessels. Depending on the glucose level, a portion of this light is absorbed while the rest is reflected. The receiver detects the reflected light and converts it into an electrical signal. These variations in signal strength correlate with the amount of glucose present in the bloodstream, and this data is sent to the NodeMCU microcontroller for further analysis. The effectiveness of this module depends heavily on its hardware configuration. Accurate glucose measurement requires careful alignment of the transmitter and receiver, as well as control over the intensity of the emitted infrared light. Calibration during setup accounts for factors such as skin thickness, sensor placement, and environmental interference. Together, these considerations ensure that the infrared module provides reliable and consistent data for glucose monitoring.
