# POST DISCHARGE PATIENT TRACKING AND APPOINTMENT RESCHEDULING FOR DIABETES

# INTRODUCTION
  Since millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes, glucose monitoring is essential to managing the chronic illness. For patients who need frequent testing, traditional monitoring approaches entail intrusive procedures that can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Noninvasive glucose monitoring options have surfaced as a result of technological breakthroughs, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor systems. The goal of this project is to create a seamless, affordable, and noninvasive glucose monitoring system by integrating an infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver module with a NodeMCU microcontroller and a cloud-based platform for data viewing and communication.
